When a user submits a burger's name, the application will display the burger on the left side of the page.

The new burger is now ready to be devoured.

When the user clicks on the devour button, the burger will be devoured. The freshly devoured burger will then move to the right side of the page and rest in burger heaven.

This application follows the MVC design pattern and uses Node and MySQL to route and query data. Handlebars is used to generate html.

Since the application uses MySQL to store our data, the data is persistent. Any data changes made from the application will be reflected on the database.
